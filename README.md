## ðŸ“• About

**IMCTracker** is a mobile app that I created during the React Native Course from the [**OneBitCode**](https://onebitcode.com/) learning platform. The course allowed me to have a first contact with the React Native technology, so that I could then create this mobile app that is a IMC Calculator.
